   <title>The Latest in Enterprise Software at OpenText’s Future Forward Event</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/08/14/opentext-future-forward/"/>
   <updated>2017-08-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AxTgMGYq3ymDq4ZERIbjCw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in the history of OpenText’s Enterprise World Conferences, the Future Forward event was held for students interested in how the latest technology is shaping the future of enterprises worldwide. I had the opportunity to attend the event and was blown away by the vast array of software companies are using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with learning about OpenText’s offerings, a series of TED-style talks were held exclusively for Future Forward attendees. The speakers ranged from Craig Haney (Communitech) to Feridun Hamdullahpur (President, University of Waterloo). Here are some of the key takeaways I had from the event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;artificial-intelligence-is-the-future&quot;&gt;Artificial Intelligence is the Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI presents one of the most interesting opportunities of the 21st century, and the conference continued to reinforce that message. Almost every speaker at the event made mention of “Artificial Intelligence” or “AI” at least once. Stephen Piron from deeplearni.ng shared the multitude of applications his technology can have in an enterprise setting. For instance, he described how his deep learning based technology was consistently able to outperform the traditional model banks use to estimate credit card delinquency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the speaker sessions, we had the opportunity to explore the expo hall floor, home to a variety of software made by OpenText and other companies. Plenty of these technologies featured analytics tools designed to make estimates and recommendations powered by learning algorithms. Businesses can draw conclusions from data to help them with crucial decision-making, optimization of processes, identification of potential risks, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-and-handling-big-data-is-a-priority&quot;&gt;Managing and Handling Big Data is a Priority&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to power all of the tailored experiences provided by software, a company’s IT infrastructure must be equipped to handle increasing amounts of data in a secure way. At the conference expo, there were plenty of services exhibiting their technology for keeping enterprise data organized. I came across booths specializing in everything from data encryption to scalable servers designed for enterprise infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As companies deal with more and more information, faster processing will be necessary to fully harness the power of all their data. It was great to hear Martin Laforest, from the Institute of Quantum Computing, share the basics of quantum computing, a revolution in computing designed to increase efficiency and change computing for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;retail-will-never-be-the-same&quot;&gt;Retail Will Never be the Same&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference also featured Mark Bergen, from Shopify Plus, who spoke about the changing needs of the retail industry as consumers make the shift from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce. He also shared the Shopify story, how a small online retailer started out selling snowboards and eventually grew to work with enterprise and celebrity clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shifts in retail have presented both opportunities and challenges for small and large businesses alike. Many newer retailers are building with a digital-first mindset to keep up with the fast-moving industry players, such as Amazon, whose Prime Day event had thousands of sales being made each minute. As consumers continue to rapidly adopt e-commerce, retailers who aren’t able to connect with their customers will be bound for failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the conference was an insightful experience for getting exposure to the challenges faced by enterprises in today’s rapidly changing digital environment. It was also an amazing opportunity to connect with fellow like-minded students, and I would highly recommend the Future Forward conference to any students interested in the intersection of business and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My DECA Experience</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2016/06/01/deca-experience/"/>
   <updated>2016-06-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2016/06/01/deca-experience</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rushi.me/images/banner-in.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DECA was a pivotal part of my high school career. Although a blog post cannot encapsulate all the memories and growth I experienced during my time in DECA, I hope it gives you a quick look into what the organization is about.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my first week of high school when one of my best friends told me I should check out the introductory meeting for a club called DECA. After learning about the club at the meeting, I was quite reluctant to join because I wasn’t too sure if I was going to enjoy competing in a business competition. What I didn’t realize at the time was that DECA is a lot more than just a “business competition.” Fortunately, my friend convinced me to join and compete in a team role-play event together just to see how well we could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After barely scraping past regionals, it was time to prepare for provincials. I attended a few meetings and quickly noticed that DECA was an integral part of many students high school experience. The chapter executive team was led by grade elevens and twelves who had built their leadership experience through the club. I was inspired by their actions, and decided to commit myself to continue to grow as a leader within DECA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was finally time for my first provincial competition at the Toronto Sheraton Centre. As soon as I entered the building, I was blown away by the thousands of students who had come together from all across the province to compete and network. As the event progressed, I had the opportunity to connect with fellow students who would go on to become some of my best friends through my high school career. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to qualify to compete at internationals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, thanks to the amazing advisors at my chapter, I was given the opportunity to attend the Leadership Development Academy at the International Career Development Conference. The academy taught me a lot about leadership and how to build experience through DECA by becoming more engaged with the organization and the different facets of it. The trip also gave me a glimpse into the competition at the international level, and the calibre required to win at the global stage. I knew there was a long way for me to go if I wanted to be able to place first worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-it-takes-to-win&quot;&gt;What It Takes To Win&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that I would compete in Sports and Entertainment Marketing because of my passion towards both the sports and entertainment industries. To help train for competition, I spent a lot of time learning as much as I could about industry and the different strategies and tactics employed by the market leaders of today. After placing second at regionals in grade ten, I headed into my second provincial competition confident that I would move forward to internationals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I didn’t move forward. In fact, my roleplays were weaker than they were in grade nine. I was crushed. But that’s when I learned you can’t just win something based on a little bit of extra effort. If you really want to win, you shouldn’t be spending hours and hours locked up in a room studying, but instead, simply focus. During the months after provincials, I reflected a lot about what I wanted to do. I continued to commit myself to my goal from grade nine of becoming a Provincial Executive Officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of grade eleven, I became more involved in my school than ever before. I joined different clubs and learned a lot about holding events through my involvement in Impact Tomorrow.  I did my best to attend as many DECA-related events as I could and continued to grow my network within the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it was time to compete again at provincials, where I had never done well enough to move on. But this time would be different. I managed to place fifth, which would be enough to qualify me to compete at the international conference in Orlando, Florida. I was super excited to see that my hard work payed off, and finally have the chance to represent my province on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competing at internationals was a phenomenal experience. The case studies were more detailed than other competitions and required quick problem solving to come up with a solution within 10 minutes. I had a ton of fun competing in the first round and found myself in the final round. I was nervous and excited to compete in the finals the first time I was competing at ICDC. After competing, I headed back to the hotel to change and get ready for the awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My category was called up late in the award ceremony, and I had somehow managed to place first. As I went up to pick up the trophy, I didn’t even realize what had just happened, but after a few moments, I was extremely happy that I had managed to place first in Sports and Entertainment Marketing, an accomplishment that I could only dream of months earlier. Fortunately for me, this wasn’t my last DECA dream that would materialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/loXPOB3yddQ?color=white&amp;amp;theme=light&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;becoming-a-leader&quot;&gt;Becoming a Leader&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all the fun I had competing in DECA, I would definitely say the best thing about DECA was the chance to grow my leadership skills. I had the opportunity to work in small teams, school-wide teams, and eventually even help lead at the provincial level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my first two ICDC trips, I took part in two different leadership academies. As described earlier, in my first year, I attended the Leadership Development Academy designed for younger students to learn how to start making an impact. In grade ten, I attended the LEADS academy, designed for students who would become state/provincial officers. The academy had a focus on what sorts of skills you need to lead an entire association, as well as how to manage the load through smaller goal-setting. I was also able to connect with incoming state officers and learn from the different initiatives they have in place in their regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking part in the LDA, I was inspired to apply to the executive team at my school’s DECA chapter. I was able to secure a role on the team as the lead of the junior executive team and get my first chance to engage myself as a leader within DECA. As a chapter executive, one of the main things I did was improve the category registration process we had for our large chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was still one more DECA dream left to achieve, and that was to become a DECA Provincial Executive Officer. After a rigorous selection process, I was selected to serve on the provincial executive team as an events coordinator. Our 8 student executive team was responsible for representing the 10,000+ members and leading initiatives to improve member engagement. Specifically, my role as events coordinator involved helping prepare and set up for all the events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the year went on, we made countless memories and had the chance to connect with leaders across many industries. I got to attend a Toronto Marlies game and meet with entrepreneurs from Waterloo’s Velocity program. Personally, my favourite part about being an officer was the provincial conference. As an events coordinator, it was great to learn more about how the entire provincial conference is run from a behind-the-scenes perspective. . During the provincial conference, the executive team addresses the entire conference during the awards ceremony. This was a great way to improve my public speaking skills and build experience with addressing a large group of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaways--future-outlook&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways &amp;amp; Future Outlook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ups and downs, challenges and opportunities helped me learn and mature as a student and professional. I learned the following key lessons along the way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aim high - set goals for yourself that may seem impossible at first&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect - whenever you have a chance, talk to the people around you, you never know what you’ll learn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Persevere - you’ll never get what you want the first time around. Always be planning with your goals in mind&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create - sometimes opportunities won’t present themselves in plain-sight. Figure out how to convey the value you can add to a project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, I plan on continuing to remain involved with DECA Ontario as an alumn by giving back to the organization. I’m hoping to judge at a few competitions and help mentor aspiring student leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Igniting Entrepreneurship with Impact Tomorrow</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2016/05/01/igniting-entrepreneurship/"/>
   <updated>2016-05-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2016/05/01/igniting-entrepreneurship</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAANjAAAAJGU0MjcyZDdhLTQ3ZWUtNDlmMi1hOWIxLTgzZWI0MjM4MWFkZQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If you can dream it, you can do it”- Walt Disney&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the world’s most pivotal moments have been inspired by the dream and vision of an entrepreneur. Over the past several years, we’ve been fortunate to witness the world change in ways that seemed impossible a decade ago. Whether it is self driving cars or state-of-the-art entertainment systems, innovation has powered our way of living and will continue to do so for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurship continues to be glamorized for youth, with many students lacking an understanding of the stories and struggles faced by business owners local and internationally. That’s why I decided to get involved with Impact Tomorrow and help high school students connect with entrepreneurs and learn from their experiences and perhaps even start their own ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-involved&quot;&gt;Getting Involved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In grade ten, I learned that a group of older students at my high school were working on a conference for their DECA Entrepreneurship Promotion Project entry. I reached out to them to get involved with helping them make the conference a reality, and they told me I could help them out with organizing ticket sales and promoting the conference. I helped them set up an online system for managing the registrants and also had a great time helping out at the conference itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inaugural conference was a great success and featured speakers such as the CEO of the Economic Club of Canada and local leaders who held a great discussion with the attendees. The conference also featured a booth area where students could connect with business owners and resources from the community to help make their own dreams into a reality. The conference was very well-received and went on to be internationally recognized at the DECA conference in Atlanta, Georgia. The founding team decided to aspire higher and work towards another successful event the following year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2015-expo&quot;&gt;2015 Expo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as the first event ended, meetings began to start planning for the next event. The team worked on booking out a venue at the University of Toronto Mississauga campus and began looking for speakers. Planning for the conference was led primarily by Eric, who was able to lead us all on making the larger conference happen. To help promote ticket sales, we were able to secure a partnership with a high school group that had a network of ambassadors across the Peel region. This helped us spread word about the organization efficiently and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was finally time for conference day, everything came together the way we had envisioned. The day began with a keynote address from the mayor of Mississauga, Bonnie Crombie, and then the students transitioned into a series of workshops located across the building. The workshops were built based on the entrepreneurial method (described later) created by the founders of Impact Tomorrow. During lunch, the students had a chance to connect with sponsors, universities, and even other student entrepreneurs. After lunch, students wrapped up their workshops and then had the chance to watch the pitch competition, where students pitched their own ideas for a chance to win $1000 towards building their idea. The winning team was Cipher, which has turned into a large community of coders and creators based in Brampton, Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/H2VYj7JgTXA?color=white&amp;amp;theme=light&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;entrepreneurial-method&quot;&gt;Entrepreneurial Method&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying methods taught during the workshops at the conference were based on research by Dr. Saras, Sarasvathy, who was the co-founder of the Effectuation Theory. The Impact Tomorrow founding team was able to use this research to develop a curriculum that would help guide young students passionate about building their own businesses. They coined this curriculum the “Entrepreneurial Method” and have used it at all their events as a mechanism for teaching youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the method is not the way all startups have come into fruition, we believe it can provide a simple framework for students who would like to learn about the process of starting a venture. The process is broken down into five simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determining a Problem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ideation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Market Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unique Means and Goals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Affordable Loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re always looking for new ways for Impact Tomorrow to grow and help spread an innovation mindset and entrepreneurial spirit to high school students. Check out our social media pages on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/impacttomorrow&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/impacttomorrow&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/impact-tomorrow&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, or feel free to reach out to me personally to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What Happens at a DECA ICDC Leadership Academy?</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2015/02/15/deca-leadership-academy/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2015/02/15/deca-leadership-academy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.decadirect.org/wp-content/uploads/data-import/06/06f4d708f6e41b217f07971612b46b06-lda.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my freshman year of high school, I took part in the Leadership Development Academy at DECA’s International Career Development Conference. At that point in time, I wasn’t too sure of what it meant to be a leader, or what skills were needed to start an initiative and make an impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leadership academy experience starts by sitting down at a random table with other DECA members from around the world who you don’t know at all. After some quiet introductions at the table, the workshop leaders began their session. One of the first things they did was guaranteed that we would be very loud and excited for the “graduation” at the end of the conference. I found this quite hard to believe, considering how shy we all were at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, time went on, and we soon found ourselves showing our true personalities, as we got more comfortable with everyone else in the academy. We were put into different color groups, I was in the orange group, and we spent the first part of the day working on coming up with a group cheer to motivate the team. As each group did the same, we soon developed a deep love for our group and rivalry began to form between the others. When we met in the hallways for instance, we would try to see who could sing their cheer the loudest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the color group rivalries, we quickly found ourselves immersed in very in-depth lessons that taught us fundamental leadership concepts. We learned about how to get more involved with a team and how to motivate others. There was also an extremely fun session where we had to use LEGO bricks to improve our communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most useful sessions was about networking. The workshop really taught me how to approach someone in a professional business environment, and what I should discuss with him or her. We were also given the opportunity to practice these techniques with our fellow group members, and ask questions in case we did not fully understand the skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshops are also all accompanied by fun times, like singing and dancing with team members, and making life-long memories. At the end of the academy, we had the chance to do the Harlem shake too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closing ceremony was, as promised, very loud! The entire experience culminated into a sad goodbye, but the memories made and concepts learned would last forever. The strong skillset built during this academy has definitely made a huge impact on my life as a high school student and will continue to impact the decision I make in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leadership academies at DECA’s International Career Development Conference are nothing short of spectacular, and you will get to learn a lot about the business world, while at the same time having lots of fun. If you have the chance to attend one during your time as a DECA member, I highly encourage you to go for it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decadirect.org/January-2015/What-Happens-at-a-DECAICDC-Leadership-Academy/&quot;&gt;DECA Direct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>6 Great Online Resources to Help You Train for DECA Competitive Events</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2014/09/30/deca-resources/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2014/09/30/deca-resources</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.decadirect.org/wp-content/uploads/data-import/26/26bf40d87712ed9dd43ba3703481a310-compete.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training for competitive events in DECA can get quite difficult, especially when trying to manage your DECA studies with your other, everyday homework assignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are a few online resources available that will help you save time and get you on your way to DECA success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/strong&gt; - An excellent resource for business articles, new ideas, and trends in the world of business, the Harvard Business Review is a must-read that will help keep you updated on what’s going on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evernote&lt;/strong&gt; - When you are studying for DECA and visiting websites online, you may want a tool that can save articles and snippets from webpages for you to annotate and edit. Not only does Evernote offer this feature, but, you can also use Evernote to take notes from textbooks. The app will also synchronize your notes across all your devices, which is a useful feature. Evernote works on Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skype&lt;/strong&gt; - Studying for DECA on your own can get boring after a while, and you may want to study with other chapter members. Using Skype will let you easily set up a group audio call to communicate and share ideas. I find it helpful to perform case studies over Skype, and have the person on the other end of the call take notes and mark you. Skype has apps for Windows, Xbox, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Amazon Fire, certain TV’s, and BlackBerry 10. If you don’t want to download Skype, you may want to consider using Google Hangouts which is a very similar service.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Drive&lt;/strong&gt; - When working with your fellow team members on a written report, it can be hard to keep track of who is working on what, and collaborating in real-time can be difficult. Fortunately, you can use Google Drive to work on and edit documents together. It is very simple to use, and all it requires is a Google account. In addition to word processing, you can also work together on slideshows and spreadsheets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KhanAcademy&lt;/strong&gt; - Although you may view KhanAcademy as a service that helps you with math and science, they also have plenty of videos on some fundamental business concepts. Topics range from Accounting to Foreign Exchange, and they even have interviews with Entrepreneurs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coursera&lt;/strong&gt; - If you really want to work on developing a particular skill for DECA competition, then you may want to sign up for an online class in that discipline. Coursera offers many free online courses in the business area. If a course you are looking for isn’t on Coursera, you may want to try looking on edX or Udacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you stay focused, stay diligent and stay on top of your training, I’m sure we’ll be seeing you on the #DECAICDC stage next spring!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lanyon is an unassuming &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It’s based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://getpoole.com&quot;&gt;Poole&lt;/a&gt;, the Jekyll butler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;built-on-poole&quot;&gt;Built on Poole&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mdo&quot;&gt;@mdo&lt;/a&gt;. Poole, and every theme built on it (like Lanyon here) includes the following:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, &lt;a href=&quot;/404&quot;&gt;404&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/atom.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;, posts, and &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;example page&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mobile friendly design and development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easily scalable text and component sizing with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rem&lt;/code&gt; units in the CSS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lanyon-features&quot;&gt;Lanyon features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via &lt;strong&gt;☰&lt;/strong&gt; link in top corner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout&quot;&gt;reverse&lt;/a&gt; (right sidebar), available via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; classes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes&quot;&gt;Eight optional color schemes&lt;/a&gt;, available via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme&quot;&gt;Head to the readme&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;browser-support&quot;&gt;Browser support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;download&quot;&gt;Download&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/lanyon&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;
  Howdy! This is an example blog post that shows several types of HTML content supported in this theme.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;dis parturient montes&lt;/a&gt;, nascetur ridiculus mus. &lt;em&gt;Aenean eu leo quam.&lt;/em&gt; Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Curabitur blandit tempus porttitor. Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etiam porta &lt;strong&gt;sem malesuada magna&lt;/strong&gt; mollis euismod. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum. Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inline-html-elements&quot;&gt;Inline HTML elements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element&quot;&gt;Mozilla Developer Network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To bold text&lt;/strong&gt;, use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;To italicize text&lt;/em&gt;, use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abbreviations, like &lt;abbr title=&quot;HyperText Markup Langage&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt; should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;abbr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, with an optional &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; attribute for the full phrase.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Citations, like &lt;cite&gt;— Mark otto&lt;/cite&gt;, should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Deleted&lt;/del&gt; text should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;ins&gt;inserted&lt;/ins&gt; text should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ins&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Superscript &lt;sup&gt;text&lt;/sup&gt; uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and subscript &lt;sub&gt;text&lt;/sub&gt; uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;Heading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vivamus sagittis lacus vel augue rutrum faucibus dolor auctor. Duis mollis, est non commodo luctus, nisi erat porttitor ligula, eget lacinia odio sem nec elit. Morbi leo risus, porta ac consectetur ac, vestibulum at eros.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What's Jekyll?</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2013/12/31/whats-jekyll/"/>
   <updated>2013-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2013/12/31/whats-jekyll</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown&quot;&gt;the project’s readme&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory […] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your project’s page or blog right here from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Lanyon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find out more by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&quot;&gt;visiting the project on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
