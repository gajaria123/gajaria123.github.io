  <h1 class="post-title">6 Great Online Resources to Help You Train for DECA Competitive Events</h1>

<p>Training for competitive events in DECA can get quite difficult, especially when trying to manage your DECA studies with your other, everyday homework assignments.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are a few online resources available that will help you save time and get you on your way to DECA success.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<ol>
  <li><strong>Harvard Business Review</strong> - An excellent resource for business articles, new ideas, and trends in the world of business, the Harvard Business Review is a must-read that will help keep you updated on what’s going on.</li>
  <li><strong>Evernote</strong> - When you are studying for DECA and visiting websites online, you may want a tool that can save articles and snippets from webpages for you to annotate and edit. Not only does Evernote offer this feature, but, you can also use Evernote to take notes from textbooks. The app will also synchronize your notes across all your devices, which is a useful feature. Evernote works on Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry.</li>
  <li><strong>Skype</strong> - Studying for DECA on your own can get boring after a while, and you may want to study with other chapter members. Using Skype will let you easily set up a group audio call to communicate and share ideas. I find it helpful to perform case studies over Skype, and have the person on the other end of the call take notes and mark you. Skype has apps for Windows, Xbox, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Amazon Fire, certain TV’s, and BlackBerry 10. If you don’t want to download Skype, you may want to consider using Google Hangouts which is a very similar service.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Drive</strong> - When working with your fellow team members on a written report, it can be hard to keep track of who is working on what, and collaborating in real-time can be difficult. Fortunately, you can use Google Drive to work on and edit documents together. It is very simple to use, and all it requires is a Google account. In addition to word processing, you can also work together on slideshows and spreadsheets.</li>
  <li><strong>KhanAcademy</strong> - Although you may view KhanAcademy as a service that helps you with math and science, they also have plenty of videos on some fundamental business concepts. Topics range from Accounting to Foreign Exchange, and they even have interviews with Entrepreneurs.</li>
  <li><strong>Coursera</strong> - If you really want to work on developing a particular skill for DECA competition, then you may want to sign up for an online class in that discipline. Coursera offers many free online courses in the business area. If a course you are looking for isn’t on Coursera, you may want to try looking on edX or Udacity.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you stay focused, stay diligent and stay on top of your training, I’m sure we’ll be seeing you on the #DECAICDC stage next spring!</p>
