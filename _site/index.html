        The Latest in Enterprise Software at OpenText’s Future Forward Event

<p>For the first time in the history of OpenText’s Enterprise World Conferences, the Future Forward event was held for students interested in how the latest technology is shaping the future of enterprises worldwide. I had the opportunity to attend the event and was blown away by the vast array of software companies are using.</p>

<p>Along with learning about OpenText’s offerings, a series of TED-style talks were held exclusively for Future Forward attendees. The speakers ranged from Craig Haney (Communitech) to Feridun Hamdullahpur (President, University of Waterloo). Here are some of the key takeaways I had from the event:</p>

        My DECA Experience

<p><em>DECA was a pivotal part of my high school career. Although a blog post cannot encapsulate all the memories and growth I experienced during my time in DECA, I hope it gives you a quick look into what the organization is about.</em></p>

<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>It was my first week of high school when one of my best friends told me I should check out the introductory meeting for a club called DECA. After learning about the club at the meeting, I was quite reluctant to join because I wasn’t too sure if I was going to enjoy competing in a business competition. What I didn’t realize at the time was that DECA is a lot more than just a “business competition.” Fortunately, my friend convinced me to join and compete in a team role-play event together just to see how well we could do.</p>

<p>After barely scraping past regionals, it was time to prepare for provincials. I attended a few meetings and quickly noticed that DECA was an integral part of many students high school experience. The chapter executive team was led by grade elevens and twelves who had built their leadership experience through the club. I was inspired by their actions, and decided to commit myself to continue to grow as a leader within DECA.</p>

        Igniting Entrepreneurship with Impact Tomorrow

<p>Many of the world’s most pivotal moments have been inspired by the dream and vision of an entrepreneur. Over the past several years, we’ve been fortunate to witness the world change in ways that seemed impossible a decade ago. Whether it is self driving cars or state-of-the-art entertainment systems, innovation has powered our way of living and will continue to do so for years to come.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurship continues to be glamorized for youth, with many students lacking an understanding of the stories and struggles faced by business owners local and internationally. That’s why I decided to get involved with Impact Tomorrow and help high school students connect with entrepreneurs and learn from their experiences and perhaps even start their own ventures.</p>

<p>During my freshman year of high school, I took part in the Leadership Development Academy at DECA’s International Career Development Conference. At that point in time, I wasn’t too sure of what it meant to be a leader, or what skills were needed to start an initiative and make an impact.</p>
