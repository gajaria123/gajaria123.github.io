I live each and every day with the above quote in my head. I am a huge believer in taking every opportunity you get to strive to make an impact on the world around you. I have a plethora of experiences in software development, marketing, leadership, and public speaking. Paired with my passion for entrepreneurship, I love to envision the endless possibilities for our world.

I'll be blogging about a variety of topics, so stay tuned for posts about tech, innovation, leadership, and much more.
